<p id="last">Research on the trade of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and NÃ®mes, France. GÃªnes, the French word for Genoa, may be the origin of the word "jeans". In NÃ®mes, weavers tried to reproduce jean fabric but instead developed a similar twill fabric that became known as denim, "de NÃ®mes" , meaning "from NÃ®mes". Genoa's jean fabric was a fustian textile of "medium quality and of reasonable cost", very similar to cotton corduroy for which Genoa was famous, and was "used for work clothes in general". The Genoese navy equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric that could be worn wet or dry.[4][5] NÃ®mes's "denim" was coarser, considered higher quality, and was used "for over garments such as smocks or overalls".[6]:â€Š23â€Š In 1576, a quantity of "jean fustians" arrived into the port of Barnstaple on a vessel from Bristol.[7] Nearly all indigo, needed for dyeing, came from indigo bush plantations in India until the late 19th century. It was replaced by indigo synthesis methods developed in Germany.[8]</p>
